(Revised by Nick 9:02pm 9/26)

Robo-Wars is a simple, multiplayer board game, in which each player possesses a team of robots, each equipped with a unique combination of attributes. The Scout, Sniper, and Tank robots each vary in their attack points, health points, range points, and mobility points. The objective is to be the only remaining player possessing a live robot. Eliminating other player's robots is accomplished by moving around the board and shooting at spaces, causing robots occupying the targeted space to lose health points. A robot is eliminated when its health points are depleted to zero. The project will be implemented using Java, an object-oriented programming language. The project goal is to design and implement the Robo-Wars game. The application program will consist of a series of screens: the title, selection of human or AI players, options screen, records screen, game screen, and a results screen. The game screen will contain interactive components that allow each player to manipulate their pieces and play the game. The remaining screens will also contain basic interactive elements that allow the user to setup a game and view game results. The application will also include an interpretor for reading programs for the AI written in Forth.
