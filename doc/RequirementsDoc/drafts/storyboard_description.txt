After the Host launches the application, the Host will be shown the Title Window. From the Title Window, the Host can visit the Robot Archive Window by clicking the "Robot Archive" button, the Game Settings Window by clicking the "Settings" button, the Player Select Window by clicking the "New Game" button, and exit the application by clicking the "Exit" button. From the Player Select Window, the Host can open the Robot Selection Window by clicking the "Select AI" button, provided the Host has selected at least one Player to be an AI controlled Player, visit the Game Options Window by clicking the "Options" button, and can start playing a game in the Game Window by clicking the "Start Game" button. In the Game Window, a Player can play the game using the mouse to move and shoot by clicking a space to bring up the context menu or open the Game Log Window by toggling it on the left side of the window. After the game has finished and a winner has been determined the Player is shown the Results Window. From the Results Window the Player can return the Game Window to play another game with the same setup and options as the previous game by clicking the rematch button, view the Game Log Window for the entire game by clicking the "View Log" button, or return to the Title Window by clicking the "Title Page" button. A typical flow of interaction begins when the Host launches the application, starts a new game, selects two Human Players and names them, plays the game to the end, then returns to the Title Window, and exits the application. Alternatively, the Host could start the application, visit the Robot Archive to revise a robot file, start a new game, select two human players and one AI player, select a robot file for the AI controlled Player, choose not to save the game statistics, play the game to the end, play a rematch to the end, then view the entire game log, and return to the Title Window.
