Changes to Requirements/Design/Testing after 11/04/16
-------------------------------------------------------

-The Interpreter class needs three additional methods: sendMessage(), checkMessages(), and receiveMessage().
-Changed the stacks field of the Interpreter to protected for testing???
-changed the names of if(), while() and for() to ifBlock(), whileBlock(), and forBlock()
-Expected result for est condition for whileBlock where finished evaluates to true at first should be that the body of the loop executes exactly once.
-variable locations pushed to the stack have a '#' character appended to the front

-The interpreter needs a reference to the Team it is associated with.

-Added store() and retrieve() operations for variables
-added Timers for the loops in order to prevent malicious code from entering infinite loops.
	-Added forceLoopInterrupt and leaveForBlock fields to help enforce loop safety.
-Added hitSemicolon field to ensure that the interpreter quits when hitting a semicolon, even if there is code after the semicolon.

-Added isPlayMode field to prevent operations like turn(), shoot() etc from being triggered during initialization.
