Change 1:

The Board class stores an array of Teams, instead of an array of pieces.
Not a new decision made.
This was a typographical / inconsistency error in the design document, which is now fixed.

Remove: Piece[] pieces
Replace: Team[] teams



Change 2:

Because List is not generic, and is, by default, of type String or int(don't remember), we will
NOW USE LINKEDLIST


Change 3:

Added field: sideLenght of type int - stores either 5 or 7: the side length of the board. Needed for isInBounds method.


Change 4:
HexCoord class: Added a toString() method, needed for Logger.

Change 5: Not using boardBounds anymore. Keeping it commented out, just in case.
Why? We already have a kickass isInBounds function which takes care of this!

Change 6:
Hexcoord class: Add toVector function. - a function which puts a coordinate from standard form to a form which involves x,z, and y coordinate and gives the shortest way of getting there from 0,0,0.
 

Change 7: No need for relativeToAbsolute and absoluteToRelative (HexCoord) methods.
don't really know why we need that anymore. 

Change 8: 
Added a isSameAs() method to HexCoord class.

/**
Change 9:
The setCurrentPiece() is private. No other class should ever need it.

Change 10: currentPiece is of type int - offset of the current piece.
